# Heart-Disease-
Machine Learning Project

Cardiovascular disease refers to any critical condition that impacts the heart. Because heart diseases can be life-threatening, researchers are focusing on designing smart systems to accurately diagnose them based on electronic health data, with the aid of machine learning algorithms. This work presents several machine learning approaches for predicting heart diseases, using data of major health factors from patients.
