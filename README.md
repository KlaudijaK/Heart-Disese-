# Heart-Disease-
Machine Learning Project

Cardiovascular disease refers to any critical condition that impacts the heart. Because heart diseases can be life-threatening, researchers are focusing on designing smart systems to accurately diagnose them based on electronic health data, with the aid of machine learning algorithms. This work presents several machine learning approaches for predicting heart diseases, using data of major health factors from patients.

Project Description
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics. With cardiovascular diseases being a leading cause of death globally, early detection can play a crucial role in prevention and treatment. By analyzing patient data, our model helps medical professionals identify individuals at high risk of heart disease.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to leverage data analytics and machine learning to:

Identify key factors associated with heart disease.
Provide a predictive tool to assist healthcare professionals in decision-making.
Enhance understanding of the relationship between various health metrics and heart disease.
